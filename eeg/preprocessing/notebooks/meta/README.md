This directory contains meta information about the stimuli and the EEG setup.

* beats.v1 - beat onsets in the stimuli and cues as detected by the [librosa beat tracker][1] (version 1, subjects P01-P08)
* beats.v2 - beat onsets in the stimuli and cues as detected by the [librosa beat tracker][1] (version 2, subjects P09-P14)
* electrode_info.xlsx - EEG channel names and cab coordinates, obtained from the [official Biosemi website][2], which also has an image with the electrode locations.
* Stimuli_Meta.v1.xlsx - stimulus metadata for version 1 of the stimuli (subjects P01-P08)
* Stimuli_Meta.v2.xlsx - stimulus metadata for version 2 of the stimuli (subjects P09-P14)
